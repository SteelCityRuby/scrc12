<h2>VENUE</h2>

<p>
  The conference will take place in downtown Pittsburgh on the 5th floor of the <a href="http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/">Heinz History Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This unique venue offers a view of one of the best city skylines in the world and an immersive, "3D" re-enactment of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07zsdF0ysP0">The Immaculate Reception</a>. Where else can you get that?!

<h2 class="clear">FORMAT</h2>

<p>
  Steel City Ruby Conf is a single-track conference. That means everyone attending the conference has the same shared experience and there's no need to worry about choosing between two awesome talks. Each talk is only 30 minutes with a 30 minute break in-between to allow for the all-important <em>Hallway Track™</em>. We believe the hallway track is just as important as the speaking track, so we devote an equal amount of time to each.

    <p>
      After 12 years of coding for money, Corey Haines said enough and went
      on a year-long, journeyman pair-programming tour. Traveling the world,
      pair-programming for room and board, he spent his time teaching,
      learning and just living as a knowledge-cross-pollinating, little,
      software craftsmanship bee. For the past three years, Corey has
      focused his attention on helping developers improve their fundamental
      software design skills through the use of focused-practice events,
      such as coderetreat. He currently specializes in training teams on
      fundamental development technical practices, as well as building
      projects and products when not on the road.
