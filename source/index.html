          <h4>Corey Haines</h4>
            After 12 years of coding for money, Corey Haines said enough
            and went on a year-long, journeyman pair-programming tour. Traveling the world,
            pair-programming for room and board, he spent his time teaching, learning and
            just living as a knowledge-cross-pollinating, little, software craftsmanship
            bee. For the past three years, Corey has focused his attention on helping
            developers improve their fundamental software design skills through the use of
            focused-practice events, such as <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">coderetreat</a>.
