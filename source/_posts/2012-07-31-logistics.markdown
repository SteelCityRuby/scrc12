Steel City Ruby Conf '12 is almost here! Some logistics:

Getting to the conference
-------------------------

* [We have added more detailed instructions](http://steelcityrubyconf.org/city) on using public transportation to get from the Pittsburgh Airport to Downtown Pittsburgh.

* We will be on the 5th floor of the Heinz History Center. There will be signs directing you there Friday morning.

* Registration begins at 8am Friday morning!

Lunch
-----

* We are not providing lunch either day, but we will be leading groups to various local restaurants! We recommend bringing cash since many of the smaller restaurants are cash-only.

* [A few restaurants have even agreed to offer discounts to us!](http://steelcityrubyconf.org/city) Just show your name badge!

Things to Do
------------

* We are allowed to go through the Heinz History Museum from 10am to 5pm both Friday and Saturday. There are many neat exhibits on the history of Western Pennsylvania-- check it out during a break!

ModCloth Party
--------------

The ModCloth Party is Friday night starting at 6pm at Finnigan's Wake on the North Shore!

* We will have a bus running between the Heinz History Center and Finnigan's Wake starting around 5:30pm.

* There will also be organizers and volunteers leading walking groups from the venue there-- it's a nice 20 minute walk across one of Pittsburgh's bridges!

* Please bring your name badge to the party!

* People under 21 are welcome but we will be giving out different wristbands and complying with all PA alcohol laws. Please bring your ID if you ARE over 21.

* We have the place to ourselves until 8pm, but you are welcome to stay after that.

* Another option is going to the Andy Warhol Museum, also on the North Shore: [on Friday nights, they are open until 10pm](http://www.warhol.org/webcalendar/event.aspx?id=2065) and admission is only half price ($5!)

Many thanks to ModCloth for being an Andrew Carnegie Level sponsor and getting involved in the Ruby Community! Seriously, they're awesome, [check them out](http://www.modcloth.com/).
