We are very excited to announce that on Sunday, Aug 5 (the day after SCRC) there will be a Code Retreat! <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events/steel-city-ruby-conf-code-retreat">More details here</a>, and you need to register <a href="http://steelcityrubyconfcoderetreat.eventbrite.com/">on eventbrite</a>. It is free but there is a $15 deposit that is refunded when you attend.

The event is organized by Justin Pihony and Jim Hurne. It's being hosted and sponsored by <a href="http://www.4moms.com/">4moms</a>, a local company that does Ruby and is also in the Strip District, about 12 blocks (20 min walk) from SCRC's venue.

Corey Haines, one of the founders of Code Retreat, will be facilitating!

If you've never done a Code Retreat before, it's a day of practicing your craft without the pressure of trying to get something finished. You will be pairing (and rotating partners) all day, and you can use any language. There's a lot more information on <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">coderetreat.org</a>.
