<h3>Anti-harassment policy</h3>

<p>
Steel City Ruby Conference is dedicated to providing a <em>harassment-free</em>
conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in
any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating
these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
<em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the conference
organizers.
</p>

<p>
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
expected to comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
environment.
</p>

<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
the offender or expulsion from the conference <em>with no refund</em>.
</p>

<p>
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special
badges/head sets.
</p>

<p>
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
conference. We value your attendance.
