<h2>PITTSBURGH</h2>

<h3>
  We &lt;3 Pittsburgh
</h3>
<p>
  Pittsburgh is an awesome city with a lot of history: it was a fort in the early days of the US, it was a hub of the steel industry, and it's now becoming a center of technology, education, and health care. We have many active technology user groups, startups and incubators, and headquarters of large companies. Pittsburgh is also cheaper to travel to and stay in than larger cities like New York City or San Francisco, and we're conveniently located near Ohio, West Virginia, DC, Philly, Buffalo, and many other places that have Ruby communities but not a regional Ruby conference.
</p>

<p>
  Until now!
</p>

<p>
  Our "ulterior" motive of the conference is to show off our city as the beautiful, affordable, and fun place it is. We'd love to feed the growth of the area and make more people aware of the opportunities here! To that end, at Steel City Ruby Conf you will experience a showcase of local Pittsburgh speakers, sponsors, food, and activities.
</p>

<h3>Lodging</h3>

<p>
  Right across the street from the conference venue is a <a href="http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?moreDesc=true&ctyhocn=PITDNHX">Hampton Inn</a>. We have reserved a block of rooms for the nights of Thursday Aug 2 through Saturday Aug 4 at $149/night. You can reserve one of these rooms at this rate by calling the hotel before July 6 and mentioning Steel City Ruby Conference. The hotel has free parking for guests!

<h3>Getting Here</h3>
<p>
  Pittsburgh International Airport is located west of downtown. It is served by most major airlines and there are many convenient direct flights. You can then reach downtown by taking <a href="http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/apps/pdfs/28X.PDF">the 28X, a Port Authority bus</a> that runs about every half hour and costs $3.25 one way. You can also take a taxi, <a href="https://www.supershuttle.com/Locations/PITAirportShuttlePittsburgh.aspx">SuperShuttle</a>, or rent a car.
