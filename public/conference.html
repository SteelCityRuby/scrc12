        <h2 class="clear">FORMAT</h2>

        <p>
          Steel City Ruby Conf is a single-track conference. That means everyone attending the conference has the same shared experience and there's no need to worry about choosing between two awesome talks. Each talk is only 30 minutes with a 30 minute break in-between to allow for the all-important <em>Hallway Track™</em>. We believe the hallway track is just as important as the speaking track, so we devote an equal amount of time to each.
        </p>

            <p>
              After 12 years of coding for money, Corey Haines said enough and went
              on a year-long, journeyman pair-programming tour. Traveling the world,
              pair-programming for room and board, he spent his time teaching,
              learning and just living as a knowledge-cross-pollinating, little,
              software craftsmanship bee. For the past three years, Corey has
              focused his attention on helping developers improve their fundamental
              software design skills through the use of focused-practice events,
              such as coderetreat. He currently specializes in training teams on
              fundamental development technical practices, as well as building
              projects and products when not on the road.

              Lindsey is a Philadelphian turned Pittsburgher, teacher, and lover of
              learning. She laments the current state of diversity in the technology
              community. To that end, she is involved in projects such as <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a>,
              OSGCC, and TLI in an effort to promote open source ideals and
              programming education to all. Lindsey promotes the discussion of
              gender and privilege in technology through her somewhat controversial
              blog. In her free time, she drinks copious cups of tea and cuts and
              paints stencils on canvases and shirts.
