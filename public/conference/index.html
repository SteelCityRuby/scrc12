<h2 class="clear">FORMAT</h2>

<p>
  Steel City Ruby Conf is a single-track conference. That means everyone attending the conference has the same shared experience and there&#8217;s no need to worry about choosing between two awesome talks. Each talk is only 30 minutes with a 30 minute break in-between to allow for the all-important <em>Hallway Track™</em>. We believe the hallway track is just as important as the speaking track, so we devote an equal amount of time to each.

    <p>
      After 12 years of coding for money, Corey Haines said enough and went
      on a year-long, journeyman pair-programming tour. Traveling the world,
      pair-programming for room and board, he spent his time teaching,
      learning and just living as a knowledge-cross-pollinating, little,
      software craftsmanship bee. For the past three years, Corey has
      focused his attention on helping developers improve their fundamental
      software design skills through the use of focused-practice events,
      such as coderetreat. He currently specializes in training teams on
      fundamental development technical practices, as well as building
      projects and products when not on the road.
