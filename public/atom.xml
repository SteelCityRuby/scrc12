    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A major goal of Steel City Ruby Conf is for it to be a great first experience
for someone who has never been to a Ruby conference before.  In her post about
the inception of the conference, Carol discussed some of the factors we tried to
account for, such as keeping costs down and planning activities with a new
conference-goer in mind.  In addition to these things, we wanted to make sure
that the conference would be a safe and inviting space for a variety of people,
not just your average conference attendee.</p>

<p>We kept this goal in mind when reaching out to speakers for the conference.  We
wanted to increase the likelihood of attendees seeing people who they share
something in common with, provide some new people with the opportunity to speak
at a conference, and (most importantly) have great people give presentations that
inspire others.  We are very excited about the people who will be speaking at
Steel City Ruby Conf and think they will add to a great conference experience.
Lindsey Bieda and Steve Klabnik are planning to speak about anti-oppression and
tech, so they will be expanding on some topics related to inclusivity at the
conference.</p>

<p>A factor that discourages some people from attending conferences is concern
about harassment or an uninviting environment.  The majority of conference
participants are inviting and respectful of others, but occasionally someone&#8217;s
poor judgement ends up diminishing what should be an awesome conference
experience.  If you want some examples, go check out the
<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents">timeline of incidents</a>
at the Geek Feminism Wiki.</p>

<p>The Steel City Ruby Conf organizers agreed early on that the conference should
have an <a href="http://steelcityrubyconf.org/policies#antiharassment">anti-harassment policy</a>
to help prevent incidents and provide a safe, harassment-free environment for
everyone.  We adopted the policy suggested by the
<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism Wiki</a>
and are following many of their
<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment">other recommendations</a>.
We are proud to join a growing list of conferences that implement these policies
and encourage others to do the same to help promote inclusivity in our communities.</p>

<p>Another important part of inclusivity is outreach. The average Ruby conference
attendee who is already hooked into the community (following the right people,
blogs, podcasts, mailing lists, etc.) probaby will have an easy time finding out
about our conference. We wanted to make sure these were not the only people
who got excited about Steel City Ruby Conf.  Our outreach efforts included local
Ruby user groups, where many new people get their start in the community, and
<a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>, a group that provides low-cost,
judgment-free environments for learning software development.</p>

<p>We hope that these efforts will make Steel City Ruby Conf an inviting and awesome
experience for all people interested in attending!  Please feel free to post
any questions about our policies on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/steel-city-ruby-conf">Google Group</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I work for a decent sized manufacturing company in the Pittsburgh area. I am the
only ruby developer. We have another developer on staff, but our
responsibilities don&#8217;t usually overlap and he doesn&#8217;t know ruby. After joining
this company, I was eventually tasked with writing web apps. Now, my background
is Computer Engineering and I spent a considerable time learning lower level
programming, C/C++ and even Assembly. I thought it would be fun to learn, so I
got some books and got to work.</p>

<p>Why was this bad? It really wasn&#8217;t. Learning a new language and framework was a
lot of fun. BUT BUT BUT; it was painful at times. I had no resources besides
books, Google, and online mailing lists to find answers. Granted they were very
helpful, but I had no idea what I was missing. I would spend hours trying to
figure out some obscure bug in my code, or waiting for an answer on Stack
Overflow. I was getting ever more frustrated, especially with the speed that
Rails was moving at the time. I felt like a huge failure. How dumb could I be?
All of these cool people were making awesome stuff with Rails. What&#8217;s my
problem?!!!</p>

<p>Then I heard about these Ruby Brigades that were forming. Lo and behold,
Pittsburgh was forming one. I almost didn&#8217;t go. I was afraid. I knew I would not
know a single person there. I was obviously incapable of learning. For some
reason, I decided to go. Guess what, I didn&#8217;t know anyone there. Slowly I
started to meet people and talk about what I was doing. I&#8217;ll stress that this
took time, several meetings. As I slowly got over my anxiety, I started to make
friends and share my problems with Ruby. They challenged me to get better, and
they helped me when I got stuck. It was awesome.</p>

<p>Ever since, I have continued to have great experiences and new opportunities.
After hearing two people talking about <a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org/">Mendicant University</a>, I applied. I actually wasn&#8217;t
accepted the first time. This should have been devastating for me, but once
again my new friends came to the rescue. Steve Klabnik messaged me and told me I
had just missed the cutoff, that it came down to several of us and only a few
open spots. He encouraged me to apply again. I did, and I completed the core
skills course. Yay! I&#8217;ve got involved with planning this conference. I&#8217;ve even
sent a few pull requests to open source projects, like <a href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a>. It&#8217;s hard to describe how much this has changed me,
submitting to open source is something I never really thought I could do. I
still screw up and feel stupid, but I know that I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t code alone. Get involved. Meet new people. Just coding for a day job is
fine, but there is a whole other world out there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, in an IRC room not so far away, a few people from the
Pittsburgh Ruby Users Group were talking about the awesome time we had just had
at Ruby Conf 2011. We were really excited and had lots of neat ideas, including
this one:</p>

<pre> carols10cents: we should have a conference in pittsburgh! </pre>


<p>There was much agreement, and thus the brainstorming began! We have a google doc
with all sorts of ideas. Some of those are being used this year, some were a bit
too ambitious for our first year ;) We also called it &#8220;Project Octoconf&#8221; for a
while so that we didn&#8217;t get stuck on picking a name&#8211; not because we have any
affiliation with Github/octocat, but because we see Pittsburgh Ruby, and
Pittsburgh in general, reaching into lots of different things and slowly taking
over the world, quietly and for good, of course :D</p>

<p>Since there are so many Ruby conferences though, what would make someone want to
come to ours? Well, what <em>about</em> all those Ruby conferences? Where do you start?
What if you&#8217;re not sure about this whole conference scene? What all goes on
there? Won&#8217;t it be all people who have been going to conferences forever?</p>

<p>So we decided to try to be the best Ruby conference for someone&#8217;s first Ruby
conference. We feel strongly that interacting with the community at conferences
is one of the great things about programming in Ruby, and we&#8217;d like to help
people get into that.</p>

<p>To that end, we&#8217;re trying to keep costs down (and Pittsburgh helps with that as
it&#8217;s a relatively cheap city), do outreach to people who haven&#8217;t been to
conferences before, and plan activities with a new conference goer in mind.</p>

<p>We are so grateful and excited for all the progress we&#8217;ve made and all the
people who have helped us so far, and we hope you&#8217;ll join us for the culmination
of these efforts in August!</p>
