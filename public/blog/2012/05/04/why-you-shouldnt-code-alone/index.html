<div class="entry-content"><p>I work for a decent sized manufacturing company in the Pittsburgh area. I am the
only ruby developer. We have another developer on staff, but our
responsibilities don&#8217;t usually overlap and he doesn&#8217;t know ruby. After joining
this company, I was eventually tasked with writing web apps. Now, my background
is Computer Engineering and I spent a considerable time learning lower level
programming, C/C++ and even Assembly. I thought it would be fun to learn, so I
got some books and got to work.</p>

<p>Why was this bad? It really wasn&#8217;t. Learning a new language and framework was a
lot of fun. BUT BUT BUT; it was painful at times. I had no resources besides
books, Google, and online mailing lists to find answers. Granted they were very
helpful, but I had no idea what I was missing. I would spend hours trying to
figure out some obscure bug in my code, or waiting for an answer on Stack
Overflow. I was getting ever more frustrated, especially with the speed that
Rails was moving at the time. I felt like a huge failure. How dumb could I be?
All of these cool people were making awesome stuff with Rails. What&#8217;s my
problem?!!!</p>

<p>Then I heard about these Ruby Brigades that were forming. Lo and behold,
Pittsburgh was forming one. I almost didn&#8217;t go. I was afraid. I knew I would not
know a single person there. I was obviously incapable of learning. For some
reason, I decided to go. Guess what, I didn&#8217;t know anyone there. Slowly I
started to meet people and talk about what I was doing. I&#8217;ll stress that this
took time, several meetings. As I slowly got over my anxiety, I started to make
friends and share my problems with Ruby. They challenged me to get better, and
they helped me when I got stuck. It was awesome.</p>

<p>Ever since, I have continued to have great experiences and new opportunities.
After hearing two people talking about <a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org/">Mendicant University</a>, I applied. I actually wasn&#8217;t
accepted the first time. This should have been devastating for me, but once
again my new friends came to the rescue. Steve Klabnik messaged me and told me I
had just missed the cutoff, that it came down to several of us and only a few
open spots. He encouraged me to apply again. I did, and I completed the core
skills course. Yay! I&#8217;ve got involved with planning this conference. I&#8217;ve even
sent a few pull requests to open source projects, like <a href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a>. It&#8217;s hard to describe how much this has changed me,
submitting to open source is something I never really thought I could do. I
still screw up and feel stupid, but I know that I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t code alone. Get involved. Meet new people. Just coding for a day job is
fine, but there is a whole other world out there.</p>
